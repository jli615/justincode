## Linked List
- Linked Lists are a type of data structure in which each piece of data contains a reference link to the next piece of data, meaning that the next node can be referenced through the cucrent node
- In our code, generic T was used because we did not know which data types would be inputed into the queue, and so it allows us to use the data without specifically defining a data type
