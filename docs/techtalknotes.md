## Unit 2 Key Learnings, Tech Talk 2 Notes
- In coding languages, Reverse Polish Notation is used to calculate math expressions by using Stacks and the Shunting-yard algorithm to parse through the inputed data
   - Ex: 6 * 15 becomes 6 15 
- Operators are stored in a hash map based off of order of operations - which ones come first and thus take precedence


## Unit 1 Key Learnings, Tech Talk 1 Notes
- Queues are a type of data structure in which elements are inserted at the end of a queue and removed from the beginning - first in first out
- Stacks are a type of data structure in which elements are inserted at the beginning of a queue and removed from the beginning - first in last out

- Data Structures are a method of organizing data - variables, sequences, and databases are all data structures. Data structures and algorithms work well together to create otpimized and efficient code.
- Impaerative paradigms use statements to change a program's state. Object Oriented Paradigms use objects and classes.
